In addition to the nine assignments listed below, students are graded on participation, reflection journal entries and sessions, comprising 10% of their grade.

Reflection journal entry 1-3: Students are responsible for emailing instructors a Word document three times during the semester in which they examine their beliefs and assumptions, how past experiences affect their actions, their feelings on how the course is progressing; reactions to the readings, etc. The entries aid the in-class reflection sessions.
